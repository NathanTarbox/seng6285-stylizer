  Your id and secret aren't for security.  They're used to make sure you can retrieve your transformed images.  
  They're simple enough to sync your phone, tablet and computer, yet random enough to keep others from guessing.
  Changing your retrieval keys won't move your images, they're tied to your id and key.
